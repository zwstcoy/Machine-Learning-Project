# Machine-Learning-Project

Note: Our program uses the scikit-learn and sklearn packages. These packages requires some dependencies such
as scipy, numpy, mathplotlib, and pip. These packages should come installed with PyCharm CE on Python 2.7 interpreter. 
Please make sure they are updated to the newest version before running the program. 

How to run the code:

1. Download and decompress a zip file of the source code. 
2. Open your Python IDE. 
3. Open the project folder by navigating to the directory where you've downloaded the files. 
4. Inside the 'Code' folder, you can run any of our method by choosing the appropriate file: DT = Decision Tree, NNW = Neural Networks, LogReg = Logistic Regression.
